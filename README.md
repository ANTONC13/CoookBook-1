# Cookbook

## Description

All is simple: this project is yet another advanced cookbook.

It've been created as helper for my hobby, to show my receipts during the mysterious cooking process:)

Later, i decided to advance first simple site and make all stuff more beautiful and useful.

So here we have:

1. sqlite databese with tables of users, receipts and their intercectable groups
1. file storage for pics
1. laravel as backend
1. blade - scss - materialize as frontend
1. yarn, gulp and some other utils to deal with project

I have no tests here and this is really bad... Let't assume that this awful situation will be fixed soon.

## Installation

* Read laravel doc: https://laravel.com/docs/5.5 for manual installation.
* More useful documentation will be here soon.
